# blockchain
Simple example of a self-validating blockchain using a linked structure and Object Oriented JavaScript running on a Node.js web server.

A distributed immutable ledger is the result of distributing ledgers and performing frequent validation across recipients to spot tampering and fixing the tampered ledger. Knowing that the system can validate individual blocks (with each node having a hash that validates its neighbor), one then has the ability to put trust in the chain of blocks that will result from a syndication of the blocks of records.

This is the basis of trust in a blockchain structure.
